<summary><h2>My Stress Response:  (Click)</h2></summary>

The fawn response was recently added to the better-known fight, flight, & freeze responses. Australia has adopted the 4-F model [(Infographic_1)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing). This response primarily uses active listening to quickly identify wants of others to de-escalate conflicts and feel safe, so a healthy level of fawning behaviors can come in handy when helping others understand one another’s differing views<sup>[[#1]](https://www.jeremydetolly.com/blog/e017#:~:text=Healthy%20characteristics%20can,people%2Dpleasing%20doormat)</sup><sup>[[#2]](https://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/how-deal-overly-agreeable-people#:~:text=we%20discussed%20the,take%20a%20stand)</sup><sup>[[#3]](https://woventraumatherapy.com/blog/the-4-trauma-responses#:~:text=If%20you%20utilize%20the%20fawn%20response%2C%20it%20might%20mean%20that%20one%20of%20your%20relational%20strengths%20is%20conflict%20resolution.%20This%20can%20be%20a%20strength%20and%20it%20can%20also%20be%20important%20to%20advocate%20for%20and%20have%20your%20needs%20met)</sup>.

> *There is a fine line between genuine care for others and self-abandonment. One way this can manifest is through a mechanism known as "fawning". Instead of fighting, fleeing, or freezing, a person with the fawn response will be **extra** friendly when feeling uncomfortable or threatened<sup>[[#]](https://www.haileymagee.com/blog/2023/8/21/3-tools-for-fawning#:~:text=Instead%20of%20fighting%2C%20fleeing%2C%20or%20freezing%2C%20a%20person%20with%20the%20fawn%20response%20will%C2%A0please%2C%20accommodate%2C%20or%20be%20extra%20friendly%20when%20feeling%20uncomfortable%20or%20threatened.)</sup>. Fawning is characterized by prioritizing people above all else by doing whatever one can do to diffuse conflict<sup>[[#]](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/fight-flight-freeze-fawn-trauma-responses#:~:text=At%20its%20core,thoroughly%20with%20others)</sup>. The individual consistently prioritizes the needs and desires of others over his own and uses people-pleasing to the degree that he loses his identity entirely by disconnecting from his own emotions, sensations, and needs<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-sobriety/202303/what-is-the-fawning-trauma-response#:~:text=The%20fawn%20response%20involves%20people%2Dpleasing%20to%20the%20degree%20that%20an%20individual%20disconnects%20from%20their%20own%20emotions%2C%20sensations%2C%20and%20needs)</sup>.*

<h3>Fawning can look like: (Depending on context)</h3>

* Fighting very hard for something, then acting like never wanted it after hearing 'No' to avoid conflict <b>escalation</b><sup>[[#]](https://www.morethanquirky.com.au/fawning-the-danger-of-people-pleasing/#:~:text=As%20fawning%20is,you%20say%20no)</sup>.
* Proactive about addressing conflicts to <b>prevent issues getting bigger</b> to maintain the positive open communication environment. Dislikes unresolved interpersonal conflicts & tension in the air. Feel obligated to fix or help others from their problems<sup>[[#]](https://psych2go.net/6-signs-youre-abandoning-yourself-for-others/#:~:text=people%20who%20struggle%20with%20fawning%20often%20feel%20obligated%20to%20fix%20or%20rescue%20people%20from%20their%20problems%2C%20resulting%20in%20an%20excessive%20amount%20of%20commitments)</sup>.

* Overly cooperative & no strong opinion. Expressing preferences, but always compromising. Making decisions most often based on others’ preferences to avoid unnecessary conflicts<sup>[[#]](https://www.springsourcecenter.com/the-fawn-response-to-trauma/#:~:text=Appearing%20overly%20cooperative,on%20others%E2%80%99%20preferences)</sup>.
* Primarily involves de-escalating conflicts without asserting power or controlling others' behaviors. Also encompasses de-escalating other people's conflicts, even if not involved personally to feel safe<sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/fawning-fear-response-7377238#toc-examples-of-fawning:~:text=Becoming%20involved%20in%20conflict%20in%20an%20attempt%20to%20de%2Descalate%2C%20even%20if%20you%20are%20not%20involved%20in%20the%20situation)</sup>.
* Respond to criticism with praise, admiration, or apology<sup>[[#]](https://www.morethanquirky.com.au/fawning-the-danger-of-people-pleasing/#:~:text=Respond%20to%20criticism%20with%20apology%2C%20praise%2C%20or%20admiration)</sup>.
* Hard to stand up for myself, but easily stand up for others<sup>[[#]](https://www.wikihow.life/Fawn-Response#:~:text=You%20find%20it,making%20it%20right)</sup>.
* Smiling or using humor in a conflict while discussing uncomfortable or painful topic<sup>[[#]](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fawning/#:~:text=Smiling%20or%20laughing%20while%20discussing%20a%20painful%20experience)</sup>.
* Panic-fulled apology or friendliness to avoid conflict **escalation**. [(Infographic_2)](/resources/infographics/FawnStuck.jpg)
* Unhealthy level of tolerance or justification of others' behaviors just to keep the peace<sup>[[#]](https://www.counsellinginperth.com.au/signs-fawning-trauma-response/#:~:text=You%20can%20put%20up%20with%20behaviour%20you%20do%20not%20like%2C%20just%20to%20keep%20the%20peace%2C%20causing%20you%20to%20tolerate%20the%20things%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20want)</sup>
* Constantly doing things at the expense of your own mental and physical health. For example, your “friend” wants you to organize her party. You don’t want to do it. You have a cold and are feeling down. But, you still go out of your way to arrange the party<sup>[[#]](https://www.londontraumatherapy.com/what-is-a-fawning-trauma-response/#:~:text=Constantly%20doing%20things%20at%20the%20expense%20of%20your%20own%20mental%20and%20physical%20health.%C2%A0For%20example%2C%20your%20%E2%80%9Cfriend%E2%80%9D%20wants%20you%20to%20organize%20her%20party.%20You%20don%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20do%20it.%20You%20have%20a%20cold%20and%20are%20feeling%20down.%20But%2C%20you%20still%20go%20out%20of%20your%20way%20to%20arrange%20the%20party)</sup>.

<h3>Fawning characteristics:</h3>

> “Fawn types seek safety by merging with the wishes, needs, and demands of others."<br>
> <i>Pete Walker, Psychotherapist</i>

* Fawning requires becoming hyper-attuned to others' needs and expectations<sup>[[#]](https://wellinmindtherapy.co.uk/blog/f/beyond-people-pleasing-understanding-the-fawn-trauma-response#:~:text=When%20faced%20with%20unpredictable%20or%20dangerous%20environments%2C%20individuals%20adapt%20by%20becoming%20hyper%2Dattuned%20to%20others%27%20needs%20and%20expectations.)</sup>. It heavily relies on adaptability and emotional intelligence to act as a social chameleon by behaving in a way to fit in or saying what others want to hear<sup>[[#]](https://drannakress.com/fawn-trauma-response/#:~:text=2.%20You%E2%80%99re%20a,solutions%20to%20problems.)</sup>. The autonomic nervous system hijacks to abandon inner feelings & wants to change behaviors to **avoid further conflict escalation**<sup>[[#]](https://www.monakirstein.com/fawn-response/#:~:text=Picture%20a%20scenario,at%20all%20costs)</sup>. It is rooted from unconscious belief that mirroring perceived expectations of others will satisfy others and minimize their aggression.

* It is doing just about anything to 'keep the peace', even if that means abandoning self-identity by denying one's own instincts, feelings, and wants<sup>[[#]](https://www.pacesconnection.com/blog/the-trauma-response-of-fawning-aka-people-pleasing-part-one#:~:text=As%20someone%20with,most%20basic%20level)</sup>. In other words, it is about always prioritizing the safety of the environment and harmony of interpersonal relationships over one's well-being, resolving conflicts at the cost of inner self, feeling need to be extremely cautious to not cause any trouble, and holding oneself accountable when causing inconvenience to others.

* This trait might sound like a passive personality for suppressing own wants, but it is not defined by passivity. It is about going out of one's way to actively make connections with others by prioritizing their wants and putting others first<sup>[[#]](https://newdirectionspgh.com/counseling-blog/what-is-a-fawn-response/#:~:text=People%20exhibiting%20the%20fawn%20trauma%20response%20often%20go%20out%20of%20their%20way%20to%20please%20others%2C%20instinctively%20prioritizing%20others%E2%80%99%20needs%20over%20their%20own)</sup>. Fawning behaviors can look very active especially when helping others<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/romance-redux/201809/9-things-everyone-should-understand-about-echoists#:~:text=Echoists%20aren%E2%80%99t%20defined,ability%20to%20share)</sup> or encouraging others to open up and share their struggles<sup>[[#]](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/echoism#potential-causes:~:text=This%20trait%20is,seen%20with%20codependency)</sup>. Just like the fight response mechanism which expresses a stress in a violent or passive aggressive manner, the fawn response can expresse a stress or fear in extra prosocial or socially engaging behaviors<sup>[[#]](https://www.londontraumatherapy.com/what-is-a-fawning-trauma-response/#:~:text=Recognizing%20when%20someone%20is%20fawning%20can%20be%20difficult%20because%20the%20person%20will%20often%20be%20socially%20engaged.%20Instead%20of%20expressing%20the%20common%20survival%20responses%20like%20being%20aloof%2C%20crying%2C%20shouting%2C%20or%20being%20angry%2C%20a%20person%20might%20be%20smiling%2C%20talking%2C%20and%20laughing%20with%20others)</sup>, so it is easy for others to think the fawn fear response as just being helpful or considerate<sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/fawning-fear-response-7377238#:~:text=It%20can%20be%20difficult%20to%20address%20fawning%20responses%20because%20many%20nervous%20systems%20find%20them%20helpful.%20For%20example%2C%20a%20child%20who%20is%20fawning%20in%20school%20is%20often%20labeled%20as%20%E2%80%9Chelpful%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cconsiderate%2C%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Ca%20delight%20to%20have%20in%20class.%E2%80%9D%20Teachers%20might%20not%20even%20realize%20they%20are%20reinforcing%20a%20fear%20response)</sup>.

* After attempting the fight, flight, & freeze responses, a child may develop the fawn response in an attempt to bring some normalcy and stability to an unsafe violent environment with high interpersonal conflicts<sup>[[#]](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fawning/#:~:text=Fawning%20typically%20develops%20as%20a%20response,some%20normalcy%20in%20a%20violent%20environment)</sup>. Unfortunately, the conflict de-escalation skills that were used to handle and tolerate the high conflict environment also make the child to become a narcissist magnet<sup>[[#]](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-fight-flight-freeze-fawn-trauma-responses#:~:text=The%20problem%20with%20fawning%20is%20that%20we%27re%20cast%20into%20the%20role%20of%20Echo%E2%80%94the%20nymph%20in%20Greek%20mythology%E2%80%94and%20she%20inevitably%20attracts%20Narcissus.%20As%20an%20echoist%2C%20you%27re%20delicious%20bait%20for%20toxic%20personality%20types)</sup> and attract highly narcissistic people repeatedly<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/understanding-ptsd/202208/does-childhood-trauma-make-us-attract-narcissists#:~:text=Sadly%2C%20because%20they%20were%20primed%20in%20childhood%20to%20become%20people%2Dpleasers%20or%20to%20fawn%20their%20way%20through%20life%2C%20many%20adults%20who%20have%20experienced%20profound%20childhood%20trauma%20are%20at%20an%20increased%20risk%20for%20attracting%20narcissistic%20partners%20who%20negatively%20reinforce%20their%20childhood%20pain)</sup>, which again reinforces the fawn response.

> Although fawning behaviors are generally socially rewarded for making others feel at ease<sup>[[#]](https://www.nicabm.com/program/please-appease/#:~:text=a%20pattern%20of,it%20gets%20rewarded)</sup>, if you struggle with the fawn response, it is important to work on developing assertiveness skills to prioritize your own needs for healthier & more balanced connections with others<sup>[[#]](https://www.sabinorecovery.com/what-is-fawn-trauma-response/#:~:text=If%20you%20struggle%20with%20the%20fawn%20response%2C%20it%20is%20important%20to%20work%20on%20developing%20assertiveness%20skills%20and%20learning%20to%20prioritize%20your%20own%20needs%20while%20still%20maintaining%20healthy%20connections%20with%20others)</sup>.

> Fawner's biggest fears are burdening others and being the center of attention.<sup>[[#1]](https://www.perpetuaneo.com/echoism/#:~:text=central%20to%20being%20an%20echoist%20is%20a%20fear%20of%20seeming%20narcissistic.%20They%20fear%20being%20the%20center%20of%20attention%20or%20a%20burden%20to%20others)</sup><sup>[[#2]](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/are-you-an-echoist-without-even-realizing_l_64514a58e4b0a36ba6c3dc86#:~:text=CRAIG%20MALKIN%2C%20PH.D.%2C%20LECTURER%20AT%20HARVARD%20MEDICAL%20SCHOOL%20AND%20AUTHOR%20OF%20%E2%80%9CRETHINKING%20NARCISSISM)</sup>

I have **VERY SEVERE** interview anxiety to the point where I have interview-only awkward behaviors. Based on my past interviews, I need an icebreaker for interviews. Probably the highest chance for my normal vibe to show up in the interview will be to start with your 1 minute introduction. The more I get to know you, the less my anxiety seems to get.

I have mastered [the gray rock method](https://bayareacbtcenter.com/gray-rock-method/) to stay calm to diffuse conflicts even when getting yelled in my face<sup>[[#]](https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/articles/echoism-the-silent-condition-in-narcissistic-relationships#:~:text=experiencing%20some%20pleasure%2C%20comfort%2C%20or%20familiarity%20in%20suffering%20at%20the%20hands%20of%20a%20narcissist)</sup>, but I can't control my interview behaviors as my interview anxiety is totally out of my control. I think the nature of interviews causes some quirky characteristics of the fawn response to come out, notably:

- Acting differently or strangely to distant strangers I'm not yet emotionally invested in<sup>[[#]](https://thehealingnest.co.uk/blog/the-fawn-trauma-response-are-you-a-people-pleaser/#:~:text=had%20no%20way%20of%20controlling%20my%20own%20emotions%20or%20even%20understanding%20them%2C%20so%20would%20over%2Dshare%2C%20often%20to%20complete%20strangers.%20This%20trait%20inevitably%20either%20pushed%20people%20away)</sup>. I behave very differently depending on whether I'm interacting with strangers or people I know. My people pleasing mode gets turned on around people I know. I don't have a problem saying 'No' to strangers, but the more I know someone, the harder for me to say 'No'.<br>
When the relationship isn’t critical or doesn't invovle people of importance in my life<sup>[[#]](https://www.therapyden.com/blog/posted-on-people-pleasing-is-a-trauma-response-yup#:~:text=Oversharing%20or%20over%2Dexplaining%20when%20the%20relationship%20isn%E2%80%99t%20critical%20(acquaintances%2C%20strangers))</sup>, I may show very unusual reactions<sup>[[#]](https://southtampacounselor.com/blog/2021/2/5/understanding-fight-flight-freeze-and-the-fawn-trauma-response#:~:text=You%20may%20experience%20unusual%20emotional%20responses%20when%20issues%20do%20not%20involve%20people%20of%20importance%20in%20your%20life)</sup>. Luckily, as far as I can tell, such unusual reactions have only happened in interview settings (maybe interview anxiety is pushing to me to my limit).

- Fear of the spotlight<sup>[[#]](https://www.perpetuaneo.com/echoism/#:~:text=Echoists%20assiduously%20avoid%20any%20(real%20or%20imagined)%20spotlight)</sup>.

- Fear of self advocacy. Fear of asserting my wants to take up space.

- Fear of praise<sup>[[#]](https://unabashedemotions.com/what-is-echoism/#:~:text=struggle%20to%20accept%20compliments%20gracefully%2C%20often%20deflecting%20or%20downplaying%20praise.%20This%20behavior%20reflects%20a%20deeper%20discomfort%20with%20acknowledging%20and%20internalizing%20positive%20feedback%2C%20as%20it%20may%20contradict%20their%20self%2Dperception)</sup>. Struggle to accept compliments gracefully, often deflecting or downplaying praise. For example,
   - Responding to compliments with self-deprecating remarks or humor.
   - Feeling awkward or uneasy when receiving positive feedback.
   - Minimizing personal achievements and attributing success to external factors.

- Fear of attention. A fear of standing out in a group and drawing attention to oneself. i.e. Publicly acknowledging professional accomplishments and contributions.<br> Far prefers staying in the shadows, serving rather than being served<sup>[[#]](https://theawarenesscentre.com/echoist/#:~:text=Someone%20who%20shuns%20the%20limelight%20and%20far%20prefers%20staying%20in%20the%20shadows%2C%20serving%20rather%20than%20being%20served%3F%20The%20opposite%20polarity%20to%20narcissism%20has%20been%20described%20as%20echoism.%20But%20how%20easy%20is%20it%20to%20spot%20an%20echoist%3F%20Probably%20not%20easy%2C%20if%20they%E2%80%99re%20doing%20their%20best%20to%20avoid%20the%20limelight)</sup>. Much comfortable helping others behind the scenes<sup>[[#]](https://theawarenesscentre.com/echoist/#:~:text=If%20the%20narcissist,your%20own%20needs.)</sup>. Focusing on others' problems to be likable. Comfortable with attention while I'm helping others<sup>[[#]](https://www.perpetuaneo.com/echoism/#:~:text=While%20being%20noticed%20is%20OK%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20only%20within%20the%20context%20of%20what%20they%20are%20doing%20for%20others.%20Focusing%20on%20others%E2%80%99%20problems%20makes%20them%20more%20likable%20and%20lovable.%20It%E2%80%99s%20an%20unconscious%20strategy%20to%20prevent%20rejection%20while%20distracting%20oneself%20from%20one%E2%80%99s%20own%20demands%20and%20worries)</sup>. Actively reject attention to provide attention to others<sup>[[#]](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/echoism#:~:text=people%20who%20tend,the%20spotlight%20themselves)</sup>. Get satisfaction and derive sense of self from meeting the needs of people around. It's an unconscious strategy to distract oneself from one's own desires and worries. Even when I procrastinate or get stressed, I look for things to help others. I have to be mindful of my continuous cycle of putting others first while ignoring my desires as it can potentially result in a burnout.

- The objective of gray rocking is to make someone lose interest in you by not showing emotional reaction and not disclosing anything<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201911/the-price-and-payoff-gray-rock-strategy#:~:text=objective%20is%20to%20make%20someone%20lose%20interest%20in%20you.%20You%20don%E2%80%99t%20feed%20their%20needs%20for%20drama%20or%20attention.%20You%20don%E2%80%99t%20show%20emotion%2C%20say%20anything%20interesting%2C%20or%20disclose%20any%20personal%20information.%20Nor%20do%20you%20ask%20questions%20or%20participate%20in%20conversations%2C%20except%20for%20brief%20factual%20replies)</sup>.

I even spend extra time to make my request for help as concise and easily understandable as possible because I don't want to waste anyone's time more than needed as I fear of burdening others.
