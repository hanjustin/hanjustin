<summary><h2>My Stress Response: (Click)</h2></summary>

The fawn response was recently added to the better-known fight, flight, & freeze responses. Australia has adopted the 4-F model [(Infographic_1)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing).

Fawning is a way of seeking safety by mirroring perceived expectations of others and de-escalating conflicts without asserting power or controlling others' behaviors. It also encompasses de-escalating other people's conflicts even if not involved personally to feel safe.

As I predominantly use the fawn response, my biggest personality flaw is agreeing even when I want to disagree [(Infographic_2)](/resources/infographics/FawnStuck.jpg). I sometimes struggle to assert my boundaries and preferences, so I am planning to seek additional counseling sessions with psychologists for better self-advocacy.
