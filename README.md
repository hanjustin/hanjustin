<summary><h2>My want for next job:  (Click)</h2></summary>

I want to join a team with a strong engineering culture where team members value self-accountability & growth-mindset to see an error as a learning opportunity to exercise self-retrospection, practice root cause analysis skills, or improve the engineering process for future prevention.

By believing in the culture of safe to make mistakes and trusting supportive intentions of teammates, I can be transparent and easily admit I made a mistake to prioritize solving the problem by incorporating the team's constructive feedback instead of wasting emotional energy worrying scapegoating or blame-shifting.

My end goal is to leverage the collaborative environment as my psychological safe space where I can improve translating my intentions into clear communications for better self-expression and self-advocacy, which will help me rewire my brain as my psychologist said my physical pain seems to be from harsh inner critic <sup>[[#]](https://www.asafeplacetherapy.com/blog/the-fawn-response#:~:text=negative%20feelings%20gets,would%20be%20dangerous)</sup>.

<summary><h2>My Stress Response:</h2></summary>

The fawn response was recently added to the better-known fight, flight, & freeze responses. Australia has adopted the 4-F model [(Infographic_1)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing).

Fawning heavily relies on adaptability and emotional intelligence to act as a social chameleon by behaving in a way to fit in or saying what others want to hear <sup>[[#]](https://drannakress.com/fawn-trauma-response/#:~:text=2.%20You%E2%80%99re%20a,solutions%20to%20problems.)</sup>. It is rooted from unconscious belief that mirroring perceived expectations of others will satisfy others and minimize their aggression. It primarily involves de-escalating conflicts without asserting power or controlling others' behaviors. It also encompasses de-escalating other people's conflicts even if not involved personally to feel safe.

As I predominantly use the fawn response, my biggest personality flaw is agreeing even when I want to disagree [(Infographic_2)](/resources/infographics/FawnStuck.jpg). I sometimes struggle to assert my boundaries and preferences, so I am planning to seek additional counseling sessions with psychologists for better self-advocacy.
