<summary><h2>My Stress Response: (Click)</h2></summary>

Fawning is a complex trauma response developed from prolonged high conflict interpersonal relationships. This anxiety disorder always prioritizes de-escalating conflicts without asserting power or controlling others' behaviors. It primarily involves quickly adapting to the demands of others. It also encompasses de-escalating other people's conflicts even if not involved personally to feel safe. It was recently added to the better-known Fight, Flight, & Freeze responses. Australia has adopted the 4-F model [(Infographic)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing).

The external presentation is largely a positive experience for those on the receiving end, so fawning is rarely perceived as problematic. However, this comes at a great cost.
