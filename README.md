<summary><h2>My Stress Response:  (Click)</h2></summary>

The fawn response was recently added to the better-known fight, flight, & freeze responses. Australia has adopted the 4-F model [(Infographic_1)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing).

Fawning heavily relies on adaptability and emotional intelligence to act as a social chameleon by behaving in a way to fit in or saying what others want to hear <sup>[[#]](https://drannakress.com/fawn-trauma-response/#:~:text=2.%20You%E2%80%99re%20a,solutions%20to%20problems.)</sup>. It is rooted from unconscious belief that mirroring perceived expectations of others will satisfy others and minimize their aggression. A child may develop the fawn response in an attempt to bring some normalcy and stability to an unsafe environment due to frequent interpersonal conflicts usually with highly narcissistic people <sup>[[#]](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fawning/#:~:text=Fawning%20typically%20develops%20as%20a%20response,some%20normalcy%20in%20a%20violent%20environment)</sup>. Unfortunately, the fawning survival strategy that was used to handle and tolerate people with high narcissism also makes the child to become a 'delicious bait'<sup>[[#]](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-fight-flight-freeze-fawn-trauma-responses#:~:text=The%20problem%20with%20fawning%20is%20that%20we%27re%20cast%20into%20the%20role%20of%20Echo%E2%80%94the%20nymph%20in%20Greek%20mythology%E2%80%94and%20she%20inevitably%20attracts%20Narcissus.%20As%20an%20echoist%2C%20you%27re%20delicious%20bait%20for%20toxic%20personality%20types)</sup> or narcissist magnet <sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/understanding-ptsd/202208/does-childhood-trauma-make-us-attract-narcissists#:~:text=Sadly%2C%20because%20they%20were%20primed%20in%20childhood%20to%20become%20people%2Dpleasers%20or%20to%20fawn%20their%20way%20through%20life%2C%20many%20adults%20who%20have%20experienced%20profound%20childhood%20trauma%20are%20at%20an%20increased%20risk%20for%20attracting%20narcissistic%20partners%20who%20negatively%20reinforce%20their%20childhood%20pain)</sup> that attracts similar types of people, which again reinforces the fawn response.

Fawning primarily involves de-escalating conflicts without asserting power or controlling others' behaviors. It also encompasses de-escalating other people's conflicts even if not involved personally to feel safe. Fawning behaviors cause internal stress issues, but others will just see fawning behaviors as being considerate<sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/fawning-fear-response-7377238#:~:text=It%20can%20be%20difficult%20to%20address%20fawning%20responses%20because%20many%20nervous%20systems%20find%20them%20helpful.%20For%20example%2C%20a%20child%20who%20is%20fawning%20in%20school%20is%20often%20labeled%20as%20%E2%80%9Chelpful%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cconsiderate%2C%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Ca%20delight%20to%20have%20in%20class.%E2%80%9D)</sup>. Fawning is not defined by passivity, and it can be very active especially when helping others<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/romance-redux/201809/9-things-everyone-should-understand-about-echoists#:~:text=Echoists%20aren%E2%80%99t%20defined,ability%20to%20share)</sup>. It is about doing pretty much anything to 'keep the peace', even if that means abandoning self-identity by denying one's own instincts, feelings, and wants<sup>[[#]](https://www.pacesconnection.com/blog/the-trauma-response-of-fawning-aka-people-pleasing-part-one#:~:text=As%20someone%20with,most%20basic%20level)</sup>. It is about always prioritizing the safety of the environment and harmony of interpersonal relationships over one's well-being, feeling need to be extremely cautious to not cause any trouble, and holding oneself accountable when causing inconvenience to others, so depending on context, it can look like:


* Fighting hard for something, then acting like never wanted it after hearing 'No'. Changing preferences at the first sign of a conflict. <sup>[[#]](https://www.morethanquirky.com.au/fawning-the-danger-of-people-pleasing/#:~:text=As%20fawning%20is,you%20say%20no)</sup>
* Expressing preferences, but always compromising (no matter what).
* Hard to stand up for myself, but easily stand up for others <sup>[[#]](https://www.wikihow.life/Fawn-Response#:~:text=You%20find%20it,making%20it%20right)</sup>.


As I predominantly use the fawn response, my biggest personality flaw is agreeing even when I want to disagree [(Infographic_2)](/resources/infographics/FawnStuck.jpg). I sometimes struggle to assert my boundaries and preferences, so I am planning to seek additional counseling sessions with psychologists for better self-advocacy.

<summary><h2>My Want for Next Job:</h2></summary>

I want to join a team with a strong engineering culture where team members value self-accountability & growth-mindset to see an error as a learning opportunity to exercise self-retrospection, practice root cause analysis skills, or improve the engineering process for future prevention.

By believing in the culture of safe to make mistakes and trusting supportive intentions of teammates, I can be transparent and easily admit I made a mistake to prioritize solving the problem by incorporating the team's constructive feedback instead of wasting emotional energy worrying scapegoating or blame-shifting.

My end goal is to leverage the collaborative environment as my psychological safe space where I can explore to find and solve challenging problems as a form of artistic self-expression, rebuild my self-identity to untrap my intrinsic motivations, and improve translating my intentions into clear communications for better self-advocacy, which will help me overcome and rewire my stress response as my psychologist informed me that my physical pains seem to be [somatization](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/somatization/#:~:text=Somatization%20describes%20physical,improve%20their%20symptoms) from my harsh inner critic <sup>[[#]](https://www.asafeplacetherapy.com/blog/the-fawn-response#:~:text=negative%20feelings%20gets,aches%2C%20and%20illnesses)</sup>.
