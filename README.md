<summary><h2>My Stress Response:  (Click)</h2></summary>

The fawn response was recently added to the better-known fight, flight, & freeze responses. Australia has adopted the 4-F model [(Infographic_1)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing). This response primarily uses active listening to quickly identify wants of others to de-escalate conflicts and feel safe, so a healthy level of fawning behaviors can come in handy when helping others understand one another’s differing views<sup>[[#1]](https://www.jeremydetolly.com/blog/e017#:~:text=Healthy%20characteristics%20can,people%2Dpleasing%20doormat)</sup><sup>[[#2]](https://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/how-deal-overly-agreeable-people#:~:text=we%20discussed%20the,take%20a%20stand)</sup><sup>[[#3]](https://woventraumatherapy.com/blog/the-4-trauma-responses#:~:text=If%20you%20utilize%20the%20fawn%20response%2C%20it%20might%20mean%20that%20one%20of%20your%20relational%20strengths%20is%20conflict%20resolution.%20This%20can%20be%20a%20strength%20and%20it%20can%20also%20be%20important%20to%20advocate%20for%20and%20have%20your%20needs%20met)</sup>.

> *There is a fine line between genuine care for others and self-abandonment. One way this can manifest is through a mechanism known as "fawning". Instead of fighting, fleeing, or freezing, a person with the fawn response will be **extra** friendly when feeling uncomfortable or threatened<sup>[[#]](https://www.haileymagee.com/blog/2023/8/21/3-tools-for-fawning#:~:text=Instead%20of%20fighting%2C%20fleeing%2C%20or%20freezing%2C%20a%20person%20with%20the%20fawn%20response%20will%C2%A0please%2C%20accommodate%2C%20or%20be%20extra%20friendly%20when%20feeling%20uncomfortable%20or%20threatened.)</sup>. Fawning is characterized by prioritizing people above all else by doing whatever one can do to diffuse conflict<sup>[[#]](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/fight-flight-freeze-fawn-trauma-responses#:~:text=At%20its%20core,thoroughly%20with%20others)</sup>. The individual consistently prioritizes the needs and desires of others over his own and uses people-pleasing to the degree that he loses his identity entirely by disconnecting from his own emotions, sensations, and needs<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-sobriety/202303/what-is-the-fawning-trauma-response#:~:text=The%20fawn%20response%20involves%20people%2Dpleasing%20to%20the%20degree%20that%20an%20individual%20disconnects%20from%20their%20own%20emotions%2C%20sensations%2C%20and%20needs)</sup>.*

<h3>Fawning can look like: (Depending on context)</h3>

* Fighting very hard for something, then acting like never wanted it after hearing 'No' to avoid conflict <b>escalation</b><sup>[[#]](https://www.morethanquirky.com.au/fawning-the-danger-of-people-pleasing/#:~:text=As%20fawning%20is,you%20say%20no)</sup>.
* Proactive about addressing conflicts to <b>prevent issues getting bigger</b> to maintain the positive open communication environment. Dislikes unresolved interpersonal conflicts & tension in the air. Feel obligated to fix or help others from their problems<sup>[[#]](https://psych2go.net/6-signs-youre-abandoning-yourself-for-others/#:~:text=people%20who%20struggle%20with%20fawning%20often%20feel%20obligated%20to%20fix%20or%20rescue%20people%20from%20their%20problems%2C%20resulting%20in%20an%20excessive%20amount%20of%20commitments)</sup>.

* Overly cooperative & no strong opinion. Expressing preferences, but always compromising. Making decisions most often based on others’ preferences to avoid unnecessary conflicts<sup>[[#]](https://www.springsourcecenter.com/the-fawn-response-to-trauma/#:~:text=Appearing%20overly%20cooperative,on%20others%E2%80%99%20preferences)</sup>.
* Primarily involves de-escalating conflicts without asserting power or controlling others' behaviors. Also encompasses de-escalating other people's conflicts, even if not involved personally to feel safe<sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/fawning-fear-response-7377238#toc-examples-of-fawning:~:text=Becoming%20involved%20in%20conflict%20in%20an%20attempt%20to%20de%2Descalate%2C%20even%20if%20you%20are%20not%20involved%20in%20the%20situation)</sup>.

* Hard to stand up for myself, but easily stand up for others<sup>[[#]](https://www.wikihow.life/Fawn-Response#:~:text=You%20find%20it,making%20it%20right)</sup>.
* Smiling or using humor in a conflict while discussing uncomfortable or painful topic<sup>[[#]](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fawning/#:~:text=Smiling%20or%20laughing%20while%20discussing%20a%20painful%20experience)</sup>.
* Panic-fulled apology or friendliness to avoid conflict **escalation**. [(Infographic_2)](/resources/infographics/FawnStuck.jpg)
* Unhealthy level of tolerance or justification of others' behaviors just to keep the peace<sup>[[#]](https://www.counsellinginperth.com.au/signs-fawning-trauma-response/#:~:text=You%20can%20put%20up%20with%20behaviour%20you%20do%20not%20like%2C%20just%20to%20keep%20the%20peace%2C%20causing%20you%20to%20tolerate%20the%20things%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20want)</sup>
* Constantly doing things at the expense of your own mental and physical health. For example, your “friend” wants you to organize her party. You don’t want to do it. You have a cold and are feeling down. But, you still go out of your way to arrange the party<sup>[[#]](https://www.londontraumatherapy.com/what-is-a-fawning-trauma-response/#:~:text=Constantly%20doing%20things%20at%20the%20expense%20of%20your%20own%20mental%20and%20physical%20health.%C2%A0For%20example%2C%20your%20%E2%80%9Cfriend%E2%80%9D%20wants%20you%20to%20organize%20her%20party.%20You%20don%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20do%20it.%20You%20have%20a%20cold%20and%20are%20feeling%20down.%20But%2C%20you%20still%20go%20out%20of%20your%20way%20to%20arrange%20the%20party)</sup>.

<h3>Fawning characteristics:</h3>

> “Fawn types seek safety by merging with the wishes, needs, and demands of others."<br>
> <i>Pete Walker, Psychotherapist</i>

* Fawning requires becoming hyper-attuned to others' needs and expectations<sup>[[#]](https://wellinmindtherapy.co.uk/blog/f/beyond-people-pleasing-understanding-the-fawn-trauma-response#:~:text=When%20faced%20with%20unpredictable%20or%20dangerous%20environments%2C%20individuals%20adapt%20by%20becoming%20hyper%2Dattuned%20to%20others%27%20needs%20and%20expectations.)</sup>. It heavily relies on adaptability and emotional intelligence to act as a social chameleon by behaving in a way to fit in or saying what others want to hear<sup>[[#]](https://drannakress.com/fawn-trauma-response/#:~:text=2.%20You%E2%80%99re%20a,solutions%20to%20problems.)</sup>. The autonomic nervous system hijacks to abandon inner feelings & wants to change behaviors to **avoid further conflict escalation**<sup>[[#]](https://www.monakirstein.com/fawn-response/#:~:text=Picture%20a%20scenario,at%20all%20costs)</sup>. It is rooted from unconscious belief that mirroring perceived expectations of others will satisfy others and minimize their aggression.

* It is doing just about anything to 'keep the peace', even if that means abandoning self-identity by denying one's own instincts, feelings, and wants<sup>[[#]](https://www.pacesconnection.com/blog/the-trauma-response-of-fawning-aka-people-pleasing-part-one#:~:text=As%20someone%20with,most%20basic%20level)</sup>. In other words, it is about always prioritizing the safety of the environment and harmony of interpersonal relationships over one's well-being, resolving conflicts at the cost of inner self, feeling need to be extremely cautious to not cause any trouble, and holding oneself accountable when causing inconvenience to others.

* This trait might sound like a passive personality for suppressing own wants, but it is not defined by passivity. It is about going out of one's way to actively make connections with others by prioritizing their wants and putting others first<sup>[[#]](https://newdirectionspgh.com/counseling-blog/what-is-a-fawn-response/#:~:text=People%20exhibiting%20the%20fawn%20trauma%20response%20often%20go%20out%20of%20their%20way%20to%20please%20others%2C%20instinctively%20prioritizing%20others%E2%80%99%20needs%20over%20their%20own)</sup>. Fawning behaviors can look very active especially when helping others<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/romance-redux/201809/9-things-everyone-should-understand-about-echoists#:~:text=Echoists%20aren%E2%80%99t%20defined,ability%20to%20share)</sup> or encouraging others to open up and share their struggles<sup>[[#]](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/echoism#potential-causes:~:text=This%20trait%20is,seen%20with%20codependency)</sup>. Just like the fight response mechanism which expresses a stress in a violent or passive aggressive manner, the fawn response can expresse a stress or fear in extra prosocial or socially engaging behaviors<sup>[[#]](https://www.londontraumatherapy.com/what-is-a-fawning-trauma-response/#:~:text=Recognizing%20when%20someone%20is%20fawning%20can%20be%20difficult%20because%20the%20person%20will%20often%20be%20socially%20engaged.%20Instead%20of%20expressing%20the%20common%20survival%20responses%20like%20being%20aloof%2C%20crying%2C%20shouting%2C%20or%20being%20angry%2C%20a%20person%20might%20be%20smiling%2C%20talking%2C%20and%20laughing%20with%20others)</sup>, so it is easy for others to think the fawn fear response as just being helpful or considerate<sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/fawning-fear-response-7377238#:~:text=It%20can%20be%20difficult%20to%20address%20fawning%20responses%20because%20many%20nervous%20systems%20find%20them%20helpful.%20For%20example%2C%20a%20child%20who%20is%20fawning%20in%20school%20is%20often%20labeled%20as%20%E2%80%9Chelpful%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cconsiderate%2C%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Ca%20delight%20to%20have%20in%20class.%E2%80%9D%20Teachers%20might%20not%20even%20realize%20they%20are%20reinforcing%20a%20fear%20response)</sup>.

* After attempting the fight, flight, & freeze responses, a child may develop the fawn response in an attempt to bring some normalcy and stability to an unsafe violent environment with high interpersonal conflicts<sup>[[#]](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fawning/#:~:text=Fawning%20typically%20develops%20as%20a%20response,some%20normalcy%20in%20a%20violent%20environment)</sup>. Unfortunately, the conflict de-escalation skills that were used to handle and tolerate the high conflict environment also make the child to become a narcissist magnet<sup>[[#]](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-fight-flight-freeze-fawn-trauma-responses#:~:text=The%20problem%20with%20fawning%20is%20that%20we%27re%20cast%20into%20the%20role%20of%20Echo%E2%80%94the%20nymph%20in%20Greek%20mythology%E2%80%94and%20she%20inevitably%20attracts%20Narcissus.%20As%20an%20echoist%2C%20you%27re%20delicious%20bait%20for%20toxic%20personality%20types)</sup> and attract highly narcissistic people repeatedly<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/understanding-ptsd/202208/does-childhood-trauma-make-us-attract-narcissists#:~:text=Sadly%2C%20because%20they%20were%20primed%20in%20childhood%20to%20become%20people%2Dpleasers%20or%20to%20fawn%20their%20way%20through%20life%2C%20many%20adults%20who%20have%20experienced%20profound%20childhood%20trauma%20are%20at%20an%20increased%20risk%20for%20attracting%20narcissistic%20partners%20who%20negatively%20reinforce%20their%20childhood%20pain)</sup>, which again reinforces the fawn response.

I have a **VERY SEVERE** interview anxiety to the point where I have interview-only awkward behaviors. Based on my past interviews, I need an icebreaker for interviews. Probably the highest chance for my normal vibe to show up in the interview will be for us to start with your 1 minute introduction then I ask follow up questions. The more I get to know you, the less my anxiety seems to get.

I have mastered [the gray rock method](https://bayareacbtcenter.com/gray-rock-method/) to stay calm to diffuse conflicts even when getting yelled<sup>[[#]](https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/articles/echoism-the-silent-condition-in-narcissistic-relationships#:~:text=experiencing%20some%20pleasure%2C%20comfort%2C%20or%20familiarity%20in%20suffering%20at%20the%20hands%20of%20a%20narcissist)</sup>, but I can't control my interview behaviors when my interview anxiety gets high. I will try to reduce my anxiety by shifting my perspective of interview's goal from 'talking about myself' to 'learning about you or solving problems'. Outside of interviews, I claim I don't have a problem with attention unless the meeting has a large number of people. I think the nature of interviews causes some quirky characteristics of the fawn response to come out, notably:

- **Acting differently or strangely to distant strangers** I'm not yet emotionally invested in<sup>[[#]](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/7-subtle-signs-your-trauma-response-is-people-pleasing#3-You-re-either-spewing-emotions-out-of-nowhere-or-unloading-them-onto-distant-strangers:~:text=This%20might%20seem,is%20in%20place)</sup>. I behave very differently depending on whether I'm interacting with strangers or people I know. My people pleasing mode gets turned on around people I know. I don't have a problem saying 'No' to strangers, but the more I know someone, the harder for me to say 'No'.<br>
When the relationship isn’t critical or doesn't invovle people of importance in my life<sup>[[#]](https://www.therapyden.com/blog/posted-on-people-pleasing-is-a-trauma-response-yup#:~:text=Oversharing%20or%20over%2Dexplaining%20when%20the%20relationship%20isn%E2%80%99t%20critical%20(acquaintances%2C%20strangers))</sup>, I may show very unusual reactions<sup>[[#]](https://southtampacounselor.com/blog/2021/2/5/understanding-fight-flight-freeze-and-the-fawn-trauma-response#:~:text=You%20may%20experience%20unusual%20emotional%20responses%20when%20issues%20do%20not%20involve%20people%20of%20importance%20in%20your%20life)</sup>. Luckily, as far as I can tell, such unusual reactions have only happened in interview settings (maybe interview anxiety is pushing to me to my limit).<br><br>Not sure if this is related, but I seem to make a terrible first impression wherever I go. A few of my middle & high school teachers said: "In my whole career, I have not seen a student with such a drastic change in a short period of time. You were the quietest student in the classroom, but now you are one of the most talkative ones". My college friends jokingly said: "You were the most socially awkward looking person during the orientation, so I was on edge because I thought I was going to see your face on morning breaking news for doing stupid/inappropriate things". My first manager told me that one of the main reasons he hired me among all other candidates was he wanted a quiet person as he himself was a quiet person, but he soon realized how wrong he was. Once I get comfortable around new people, we sometimes talk for hours, so we resort to setting a timer 'to get back to work'.

- **Fear of attention.** A fear of standing out in a group and drawing attention to oneself.<br> i.e. Publicly acknowledging accomplishments or public speaking.<br>
**BUT** this fear is not black and white as context matters a lot. A more appropriate label is a fear of self-focused/self-centered/self-serving attention<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-your-corner/202310/why-echoism-can-make-dating-difficult-and-what-to-do-about-it#:~:text=Avoidance%20of%20self%2Dfocused%20attention)</sup>. I'm comfortable with attention while I'm helping others<sup>[[#]](https://www.perpetuaneo.com/echoism/#:~:text=While%20being%20noticed%20is%20OK%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20only%20within%20the%20context%20of%20what%20they%20are%20doing%20for%20others.%20Focusing%20on%20others%E2%80%99%20problems%20makes%20them%20more%20likable%20and%20lovable.%20It%E2%80%99s%20an%20unconscious%20strategy%20to%20prevent%20rejection%20while%20distracting%20oneself%20from%20one%E2%80%99s%20own%20demands%20and%20worries)</sup>. It depends whether the center of the topic is my own problem or problem affecting others. Also, the more rapport I have with people in the meeting, the more comfortable I get with attention. It's an unconscious strategy to distract oneself from one's own desires and worries. Much comfortable helping others behind the scenes<sup>[[#]](https://theawarenesscentre.com/echoist/#:~:text=If%20the%20narcissist,your%20own%20needs.)</sup>, serving rather than being served<sup>[[#]](https://theawarenesscentre.com/echoist/#:~:text=Someone%20who%20shuns%20the%20limelight%20and%20far%20prefers%20staying%20in%20the%20shadows%2C%20serving%20rather%20than%20being%20served%3F%20The%20opposite%20polarity%20to%20narcissism%20has%20been%20described%20as%20echoism.%20But%20how%20easy%20is%20it%20to%20spot%20an%20echoist%3F%20Probably%20not%20easy%2C%20if%20they%E2%80%99re%20doing%20their%20best%20to%20avoid%20the%20limelight)</sup>. Actively reject attention to provide attention to others<sup>[[#]](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/echoism#:~:text=people%20who%20tend,the%20spotlight%20themselves)</sup>.

- **Fear of self advocacy.** Fear of asserting my wants to take up space and fear of seeming narcissistic in any way.

- **Fear of the real or imagined spotlight**<sup>[[#]](https://www.perpetuaneo.com/echoism/#:~:text=Echoists%20assiduously%20avoid%20any%20(real%20or%20imagined)%20spotlight)</sup>.

- **Fear of praise or recognition**<sup>[[#]](https://unabashedemotions.com/what-is-echoism/#:~:text=struggle%20to%20accept%20compliments%20gracefully%2C%20often%20deflecting%20or%20downplaying%20praise.%20This%20behavior%20reflects%20a%20deeper%20discomfort%20with%20acknowledging%20and%20internalizing%20positive%20feedback%2C%20as%20it%20may%20contradict%20their%20self%2Dperception)</sup>. Struggle to accept compliments gracefully, often deflecting or downplaying praise. For example,
   - Responding to compliments with self-deprecating remarks or humor.
   - Feeling awkward or uneasy when receiving positive feedback.
   - Minimizing personal achievements and attributing success to external factors.

- Most characteristics of echoism, fawning, and gray rocking are about not being the main character, but the nature of interview is being the center of attention. Fawning is about establishing a sense of safety by being other focused. The objective of gray rocking is to make someone lose interest in you by not showing emotional reaction and not disclosing anything<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201911/the-price-and-payoff-gray-rock-strategy#:~:text=objective%20is%20to%20make%20someone%20lose%20interest%20in%20you.%20You%20don%E2%80%99t%20feed%20their%20needs%20for%20drama%20or%20attention.%20You%20don%E2%80%99t%20show%20emotion%2C%20say%20anything%20interesting%2C%20or%20disclose%20any%20personal%20information.%20Nor%20do%20you%20ask%20questions%20or%20participate%20in%20conversations%2C%20except%20for%20brief%20factual%20replies)</sup>.

**Other quirks:**

* **Fear of burdening others**. This fear affects ALL of my actions. This is noticeable on how easily I ask for help. My actions greatly change whether the help I need is for my own problem or not.
    * For problems involving others or my team, the fear pushes me to ask for help very easily as I will be creating burdens to others for not asking help in a timely manner. I even spend extra time to make my request for help as concise and easily understandable as possible because I don't want to waste anyone's time more than needed as I fear of burdening others.
    * For my own personal problem that doesn't affect anyone else, I have a very hard time asking for help as I fear of burdening others. From this fear, ironically, fawners often end up worrying that they will appear selfish and narcissistic<sup>[[#]](https://issuu.com/happiful/docs/happiful_march_2020/s/10365534#:~:text=will%20grow%20up%20believing%20life%20is%20easier%20when%20they%20take%20up%20as%20little%20space%20as%20possible%20in%20a%20relationship%2C%20and%20will%20rarely%20share%20their%20problems%20because%20they%20fear%20burdening%20others.%20Ironically%2C%20they%20often%20worry%20that%20they%20will%20appear%20selfish%20and%20narcissistic)</sup>. This is something I need to work on.

* **Strong desire to help others.** Desire to help close people is deeply embedded as a survival mechanism<sup>[[#1]](https://beatanxiety.me/the-fawn-response-when-people-pleasing-becomes-a-survival-mechanism/#:~:text=They%20become%20easy,needs%2C%20and%20identity)</sup><sup>[[#2]](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fawning/#:~:text=This%20response%20is%20an%20attempt%20to%20%E2%80%9Ckeep%20the%20peace%E2%80%9D%20and%20appease%20the%20person%20who%20may%20be%20causing%20harm%20in%20order%20to%20reduce%20the%20intensity%20or%20frequency%20of%20that%20harm)</sup>. Get satisfaction and derive sense of self from meeting the needs of people around. Instead of tending to themselves, fawners want to invest their energy into catering to other people's needs and solving other people's problems<sup>[[#]](https://www.glam.com/1289926/echoism-opposite-narcissism-just-toxic/#:~:text=Instead%20of%20tending%20to%20themselves%2C%20they%20want%20to%20invest%20their%20energy%20into%20catering%20to%20other%20people%27s%20needs%20and%20solving%20other%20people%27s%20problems)</sup>. They are great at taking care of others and solving their problems, often to the point that this is what their identity revolves around<sup>[[#]](https://www.perpetuaneo.com/echoism/#:~:text=Echoists%20are%20great%20at%20taking%20care%20of%20others%20and%20solving%20their%20problems%2C%20often%20to%20the%20point%20that%20this%20is%20what%20their%20identity%20revolves%20around)</sup>. Although fawners have convinced themselves that they are doing what they need to by taking care of or serving others, they are really denying themselves the happiness that a healthy, well-balanced individual should enjoy<sup>[[#]](https://psychcentral.com/blog/you-arent-a-narcissist-but-could-you-be-an-echoist#3:~:text=Although%20an%20echoist%20may%20think%20they%20are%20doing%20what%20they%20need%20to%20by%20taking%20care%20of%2C%20or%20serving%20others%2C%20they%20are%20really%20denying%20themselves%20the%20happiness%20that%20a%20healthy%2C%20well%2Dbalanced%20individual%20should%20enjoy)</sup>. Even when I procrastinate or get stressed, I look for things to help others. I have to be mindful of my continuous cycle of putting others first while ignoring my desires as it can potentially result in a burnout. It's really not the team size that I care. I care whether I have high number of opportunities to help others and learn from others while helping. My simple logic was: Larger team = More opportunities to interact & help, so whether the team size is large or small is not what I really care. It will take me many years to unlearn these behaviors.

> Echoists (people using the fawn response) echo the feelings and needs of others rather than assert their own wants or needs. They often seem content to simply support others<sup>[[#]](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/echoism#signs:~:text=Like%20Echo%2C%20people%20with%20echoism%20struggle%20to%20express%20themselves.%20They%20worry%20about%20coming%20across%20as%20needy%20and%20may%20lack%20a%20defined%20self%2Didentity%20or%20clear%20desires.%20So%2C%20they%20often%20seem%20content%20to%20simply%20support%20others)</sup>. They struggle to say no when others come to them for help. They are proactive when trying to satisfy the needs of others. They have convinced themselves that no one wants to hear about their problems or be with someone needy<sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-echoism-7566908#toc-how-echoism-impacts-relationships:~:text=Echoism%20is%20a%20traumatic,they%20can%20be%20loved)</sup>, so they believe the only way to have relationships with others is to give as much as possible and ask for as little as possible. They would rather hop into a freezing lake than disagree<sup>[[#]](https://www.wellandgood.com/what-is-echoism/#:~:text=you%E2%80%99d%20rather%20hop%20into%20a%20freezing%20lake%20than%20disagree%20with%20a%20coworker.%20Or%2C%20you%20hate%20being%20the%20center%20of%20attention%20(others%20singing%2C%20%E2%80%9CHappy%20Birthday%E2%80%9D%20to%20you%20is%20a%20nightmare)%20or%20want%20to%20be%20perceived%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9Ceasygoing%E2%80%9D%20friend%20who%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have%20needs)</sup> or cut off their own hand than cause someone else a burden or discomfort<sup>[[#]](https://www.yourtango.com/self/other-opposite-narcissism-echoism#:~:text=would%20rather%20cut%20off%20their%20own%20hand%20than%20cause%20someone%20else%20pain%20and%20suffering)</sup>.

* **Echoist vs Codependent**
    
    Echoists won't necessarily attempt to guide or take control of someone's actions, as seen with codependency<sup>[[#]](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/echoism#:~:text=they%20won%E2%80%99t%20necessarily%20attempt%20to%20guide%20or%20take%20control%20of%20someone%E2%80%99s%20actions%2C%20as%20seen%20with%20codependency.)</sup>. Echoists lack desire for control. They don't even want credit, acknowledgement, nor attention for their actions<sup>[[#]](https://psychcentral.com/blog/you-arent-a-narcissist-but-could-you-be-an-echoist#1:~:text=shy%20away%20from%20any%20form%20of%20praise%20or%20recognition%2C%20instead%20wishing%20to%20remain%20anonymous%20and%20in%20the%20shadows.%20So%2C%20where%20a%20narcissist%20is%20selfish%20and%20self%2Dcentered%2C%20an%20echoist%20is%20generally%20someone%20who%20feels%20uncomfortable%20in%20the%20spotlight%20or%20receiving%20praise%20or%20recognition%20of%20any%20kind)</sup>. They may instead feel more comfortable allowing others to claim the results of their hard work<sup>[[#]](https://psychcentral.com/blog/you-arent-a-narcissist-but-could-you-be-an-echoist#:~:text=They%20may%20instead,and%20potentially%20abusive)</sup>. Some extreme echoists might even get upset if you celebrate their contribution or try to do something nice for them<sup>[[#]](https://www.glam.com/1289926/echoism-opposite-narcissism-just-toxic/#:~:text=They%20might%20even%20feel%20upset%20when%20people%20try%20to%20do%20something%20nice%20for%20them)</sup> (I'm not at that level). Codependents want attention for their sacrifices, whereas echoists go out of their way to avoid recognition for their struggles. Codependents also tend to get angry if others reject their help, but echoists hate to push their desire to help when others say no as they don't want others to feel uncomfortable because of their own wants.
