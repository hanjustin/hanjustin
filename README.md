## Conflict Resolution Style:

Fawning is a complex trauma response developed as a last resort in prolonged high conflict interpersonal relationships. This anxiety disorder prioritizes seeking safety by adapting to the demands of others and by relinquishing power & control in relationships. It was recently added to the better-known Fight, Flight, & Freeze responses. Australia has adopted the [4-F model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing).

## My Personality Flaws

Fawn trauma is also called as "please-and-appease" or "tend-and-befriend" trauma. Individuals with fawning behaviors may excel in settings where collaboration & cooperation are valued over individual achievement, but may struggle to succeed in assertive & competitive environments.

The external presentation is largely a positive experience for those on the receiving end, so fawning is rarely perceived as problematic. However, this comes at a great cost.
