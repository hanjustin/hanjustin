<summary><h2>My Stress Response: (Click)</h2></summary>

Fawning is a complex trauma response developed from prolonged high conflict interpersonal relationships. It was recently added to the better-known Fight, Flight, & Freeze responses. Australia has adopted the 4-F model [(Infographic_1)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing).

This anxiety disorder always prioritizes de-escalating conflicts without asserting power or controlling others' behaviors. It primarily involves being compliant and quickly adapting to the demands of others. It also encompasses de-escalating other people's conflicts even if not involved personally to feel safe <sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/fawning-fear-response-7377238#toc-examples-of-fawning:~:text=Becoming%20involved%20in%20conflict%20in%20an%20attempt%20to%20de%2Descalate%2C%20even%20if%20you%20are%20not%20involved%20in%20the%20situation)</sup>. *([#] symbol denotes URL reference.)*

<summary><h2>My Personality Flaws:</h2></summary>

Fawning behaviors are rarely perceived as problematic as they look like socially engaging behaviors <sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/fawning-fear-response-7377238#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%20child%20who%20is%20fawning%20in%20school%20is%20often%20labeled%20as%20%E2%80%9Chelpful%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cconsiderate%2C%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Ca%20delight%20to%20have%20in%20class.%E2%80%9D%20Teachers%20might%20not%20even%20realize%20they%20are%20reinforcing%20a%20fear%20response.)</sup>. However, this comes at a great cost: self-identity <sup>[[#]](https://www.charliehealth.com/post/is-fawning-a-trauma-response-what-you-need-to-know#:~:text=Some%20key%20signs,or%20authentic%20self)</sup>. So I'm terrible at:

* Self-advocacy for fear of upsetting others. (Speaking up for myself. Confidently assert my rights, needs, & preferences.)
* Saying 'No' and setting boundaries.

My entangled internal problems are causing me to primarily use fawn responses, so I have additional problems which need to be addressed [(Infographic_2)](/resources/infographics/FawnStuck.jpg). After seeing a psychologist, I can now say 'No' a lot better, but it is still unnatural for me. I will seek additional therapies to untangle my internal problems and improve my self-advocacy.
