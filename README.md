<summary><h2>My Stress Response:  (Click)</h2></summary>

The fawn response was recently added to the better-known fight, flight, & freeze responses. Australia has adopted the 4-F model [(Infographic_1)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sHj0vrb2jOfzkrxC2eArEfjoHh4Z-Mo/view?usp=sharing).

After attempting the fight, flight, & freeze responses, a child may develop the fawn response in an attempt to bring some normalcy and stability to an unsafe violent environment due to frequent interpersonal conflicts usually with highly narcissistic people<sup>[[#]](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fawning/#:~:text=Fawning%20typically%20develops%20as%20a%20response,some%20normalcy%20in%20a%20violent%20environment)</sup>. Unfortunately, the conflict de-escalation skills that were used to handle and tolerate the hyper-critical & high conflict environment also make the child to become a narcissist magnet<sup>[[#]](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/the-fight-flight-freeze-fawn-trauma-responses#:~:text=The%20problem%20with%20fawning%20is%20that%20we%27re%20cast%20into%20the%20role%20of%20Echo%E2%80%94the%20nymph%20in%20Greek%20mythology%E2%80%94and%20she%20inevitably%20attracts%20Narcissus.%20As%20an%20echoist%2C%20you%27re%20delicious%20bait%20for%20toxic%20personality%20types)</sup> and ends up attracting similar types of people repeatedly<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/understanding-ptsd/202208/does-childhood-trauma-make-us-attract-narcissists#:~:text=Sadly%2C%20because%20they%20were%20primed%20in%20childhood%20to%20become%20people%2Dpleasers%20or%20to%20fawn%20their%20way%20through%20life%2C%20many%20adults%20who%20have%20experienced%20profound%20childhood%20trauma%20are%20at%20an%20increased%20risk%20for%20attracting%20narcissistic%20partners%20who%20negatively%20reinforce%20their%20childhood%20pain)</sup>, which again reinforces the fawn response.

> ‚ÄúFawn types seek safety by merging with the wishes, needs, and demands of others."<br>
> <i>Pete Walker, Psychotherapist</i>
>
> In the realm of human interaction, it is natural to consider the needs and emotions of others. However, there is a fine line between genuine care for others and self-abandonment. One way this can manifest is through a psychological defense mechanism known as ‚Äúfawning.‚Äù<sup>[[#]](https://psych2go.net/6-signs-youre-abandoning-yourself-for-others/#:~:text=In%20the%20realm,known%20as%20%E2%80%9Cfawning.%E2%80%9D)</sup>

<br>

Fawning heavily relies on adaptability and emotional intelligence to act as a social chameleon by behaving in a way to fit in or saying what others want to hear<sup>[[#]](https://drannakress.com/fawn-trauma-response/#:~:text=2.%20You%E2%80%99re%20a,solutions%20to%20problems.)</sup>. It is rooted from unconscious belief that mirroring perceived expectations of others will satisfy others and minimize their aggression.

Fawning is not defined by passivity, and fawning behaviors can look very active especially when helping others<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/romance-redux/201809/9-things-everyone-should-understand-about-echoists#:~:text=Echoists%20aren%E2%80%99t%20defined,ability%20to%20share)</sup>. Unlike the fight response which expresses a stress in a violent or passive aggressive manner, the fawn response expresses a stress or fear in prosocial or socially engaging behaviors to resolve conflicts<sup>[[#]](https://www.londontraumatherapy.com/what-is-a-fawning-trauma-response/#:~:text=Recognizing%20when%20someone%20is%20fawning%20can%20be%20difficult%20because%20the%20person%20will%20often%20be%20socially%20engaged.%20Instead%20of%20expressing%20the%20common%20survival%20responses%20like%20being%20aloof%2C%20crying%2C%20shouting%2C%20or%20being%20angry%2C%20a%20person%20might%20be%20smiling%2C%20talking%2C%20and%20laughing%20with%20others)</sup>, so it is easy for others to think the fawn fear response as just being helpful or considerate<sup>[[#]](https://www.verywellmind.com/fawning-fear-response-7377238#:~:text=It%20can%20be%20difficult%20to%20address%20fawning%20responses%20because%20many%20nervous%20systems%20find%20them%20helpful.%20For%20example%2C%20a%20child%20who%20is%20fawning%20in%20school%20is%20often%20labeled%20as%20%E2%80%9Chelpful%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cconsiderate%2C%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Ca%20delight%20to%20have%20in%20class.%E2%80%9D%20Teachers%20might%20not%20even%20realize%20they%20are%20reinforcing%20a%20fear%20response)</sup>. Fawning primarily involves de-escalating conflicts without asserting power or controlling others' behaviors. It also encompasses de-escalating other people's conflicts even if not involved personally to feel safe. It is doing just about anything to 'keep the peace', even if that means abandoning self-identity by denying one's own instincts, feelings, and wants<sup>[[#]](https://www.pacesconnection.com/blog/the-trauma-response-of-fawning-aka-people-pleasing-part-one#:~:text=As%20someone%20with,most%20basic%20level)</sup>. In other words, it is about always prioritizing the safety of the environment and harmony of interpersonal relationships over one's well-being, resolving conflicts at the cost of inner self, feeling need to be extremely cautious to not cause any trouble, and holding oneself accountable when causing inconvenience to others, so depending on context, it can look like:


* Fighting very hard for something, then acting like never wanted it after hearing 'No' to avoid conflict escalation<sup>[[#]](https://www.morethanquirky.com.au/fawning-the-danger-of-people-pleasing/#:~:text=As%20fawning%20is,you%20say%20no)</sup>.
* Taking blame, even unjustified ones<sup>[[#]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/modern-dating/202206/unlearning-blame-taking#:~:text=Blame%2Dtaking%20is,avoid%20further%20conflict)</sup>, to resolve conflict [(Infographic_2)](/resources/infographics/FawnStuck.jpg). (i.e. Taking responsibility or blame for the emotional reactions, behaviors, and actions of others)
* Hard to stand up for myself, but easily stand up for others<sup>[[#]](https://www.wikihow.life/Fawn-Response#:~:text=You%20find%20it,making%20it%20right)</sup>.
* Expressing preferences, but always compromising or matching others' preferences to avoid a conflict. Agreeing to accept the disagreement & opposing views to de-escalate conflict.
* Panic-fulled apology or friendliness to avoid conflict escalation.
* Smiling or using humor while discussing uncomfortable or painful topic<sup>[[#]](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/fawning/#:~:text=Smiling%20or%20laughing%20while%20discussing%20a%20painful%20experience)</sup>.
* Constantly doing things at the expense of your own mental and physical health. For example, your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù wants you to organize her party. You don‚Äôt want to do it. You have a cold and are feeling down. But, you still go out of your way to arrange the party.

<summary><h2>My Want for Next Job:</h2></summary>

I want to join a team with a strong engineering culture where team members value self-accountability & growth-mindset to see an error as a learning opportunity to exercise self-retrospection, practice root cause analysis skills, or improve the engineering process for future prevention.

By believing in the culture of safe to make mistakes and trusting supportive intentions of teammates, I can be transparent and easily admit I made a mistake to prioritize solving the problem by incorporating the team's constructive feedback instead of wasting emotional energy worrying scapegoating or blame-shifting.

My end goal is to leverage the collaborative environment as my psychological safe space where I can explore to find and solve challenging problems as a form of artistic self-expression, rebuild my self-identity to untrap my intrinsic motivations, and improve translating my intentions into clear communications for better self-advocacy, which will help me overcome and rewire my stress response as my psychologist informed me that my physical pains seem to be [somatization](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/somatization/#:~:text=Somatization%20describes%20physical,improve%20their%20symptoms) from my harsh inner critic <sup>[[#]](https://www.asafeplacetherapy.com/blog/the-fawn-response#:~:text=negative%20feelings%20gets,aches%2C%20and%20illnesses)</sup>. I tend to struggle to assert my boundaries and stand my ground after stating my preferences, so I am planning to seek additional counseling sessions with psychologists for better self-advocacy.
