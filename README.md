## My Stress Response:

Fawning is a relationship trauma response. It was recently added to the better-known Fight, Flight, & Freeze responses. Australia adopted the [4-F model](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/hanjustin/hanjustin/raw/main/resources/Australia.pdf).

## Conflict Resolution in Relationships:

Fawn trauma is also called as "please-and-appease" or "tend-and-befriend" trauma. Fawning prioritizes agreeing with others and relinquishing power & control in relationships to resolve conflicts. Individuals who developed fawn response interpersonal schemas may excel in settings where collaboration & cooperation are valued over individual achievement, but may struggle to succeed in assertive & competitive environments.

## My Personality Flaws

The external presentation is largely a positive experience for those on the receiving end, so fawning is rarely perceived as problematic. However, this comes at a great cost.
